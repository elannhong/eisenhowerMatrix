    <h1>About the Eisenhower Matrix</h1>
    <h2>What is the Eisenhower Matrix?</h2>
    <p>
        The Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix, is a simple yet powerful tool for time management. It helps you organize tasks by urgency and importance, and enables you to visualize your tasks to identify pressing tasks and sort out unproductive tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The matrix is named after Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States, who was known for his exceptional productivity and decision-making skills. Eisenhower often quoted: <em>"What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important."</em> The matrix was popularized by Stephen Covey in his book <em>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of the Eisenhower Matrix is to help you focus on what truly matters, reduce stress, and increase productivity by ensuring that your time and energy are spent on tasks that align with your goals and values.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use the Eisenhower Matrix</h2>
    <p>
        The matrix is divided into four quadrants, each representing a different combination of urgency and importance:
    </p>
    <div class="matrix-diagram">
        <div class="quadrant q1">
            <div class="quadrant-title">Quadrant 1: Urgent & Important</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Do First</strong>: Tasks that are both urgent and important.</li>
                <li>Examples: Crises, deadlines, pressing problems.</li>
                <li>Purpose: These require immediate attention. Focus on these tasks to avoid negative consequences.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="quadrant q2">
            <div class="quadrant-title">Quadrant 2: Not Urgent & Important</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Schedule</strong>: Tasks that are important but not urgent.</li>
                <li>Examples: Planning, relationship building, personal development, exercise.</li>
                <li>Purpose: Invest time here for long-term success and growth. Schedule these tasks to prevent them from becoming urgent.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="quadrant q3">
            <div class="quadrant-title">Quadrant 3: Urgent & Not Important</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Delegate</strong>: Tasks that are urgent but not important.</li>
                <li>Examples: Interruptions, some emails or calls, meetings.</li>
                <li>Purpose: These tasks demand immediate attention but do not contribute significantly to your goals. Delegate or minimize them when possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="quadrant q4">
            <div class="quadrant-title">Quadrant 4: Not Urgent & Not Important</div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eliminate</strong>: Tasks that are neither urgent nor important.</li>
                <li>Examples: Time-wasters, excessive social media, trivial activities.</li>
                <li>Purpose: Limit or eliminate these tasks to free up time for more valuable activities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>TLDR</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quadrant 1:</strong> Do it now.</li>
        <li><strong>Quadrant 2:</strong> Plan for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Quadrant 3:</strong> Delegate it.</li>
        <li><strong>Quadrant 4:</strong> Eliminate it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By regularly categorizing your tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, you can work smarter, reduce stress, and achieve your most important goals.
